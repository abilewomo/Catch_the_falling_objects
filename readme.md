<h1>Catch the Falling Objects Game</h1>
<p><img src="images/screenshot.png" width="600" alt="Game Snapshot"></p>
<p>This is a simple game designed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The objective of the game is to catch a specific number of falling objects in a bowl before the timer runs out. There are three levels to beat, and the speed of the falling objects increases as the level changes. In addition, objects that reduce the player's score are introduced in later levels, adding an extra challenge. The game is won if the player can beat all levels.</p>
